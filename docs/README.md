# Containers 101
Welcome to the "Containers 101" documentation project. The goal of this project is to create a learning resource for individuals who want to learn about emerging topics in a cloud native world where containers are the focal point.

## Mission Statement
We aim to provide a learning resource collection that is generic enough to comprehend nuances in the different solutions and paradigms. Hewlett Enterprise Products are highly likely referenced in some examples and resources. We can therefore not claim vendor neutrality nor a Switzerland opinion.

## Conventions
This is web site is rendered from the [HPE Nimble Storage "container-examples"](https://github.com/NimbleStorage/container-examples) repository on GitHub. Here are some of the conventions used.

- Pages are written in markdown. Graphics used are Copyright 2018 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP.
- Links that point to external resources are in [lowercase](https://hpe.com) and links local to "Containers 101" are in [UPPERCASE](README.md).
