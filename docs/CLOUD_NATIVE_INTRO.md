# Cloud Native Computing
The term "cloud native" stems from a software development model where resources are consumed as services. Compute, network and storage consumed through APIs, CLIs and web administration interfaces. Consumption is often modeled around paying only for what is being used.

The applications deployed into Cloud Native Computing environments are often divided into small chunks that is operated independently, referred to as microservices. On the uprising is a broader adoption of a concept called serverless where your application on runs only when called and billed in milliseconds.

Many public cloud vendors provide many already cloud native applications as services on their respective clouds. An example would be to consume a SQL database as a service rather than deploying and managing it by yourself.

## Key Attributes
These are some of the key elements of Cloud Native Computing.

- Resources are provisioned through complete self-service.
- API first strategies to promote interoperability and collaboration.
- Separation of concerns in microservice architectures.
- High degree of automation of resource provisioning and deprovisioning.
- Modern languges and frameworks.
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS)

## Practical Exercises
How to get hands-on experience of Cloud Native Computing.

- Sign-up on any of the public clouds. 
  - Provision an instance and get remote access to the host OS of the instance. 
  - Deploy a "as-a-service" of an application technology you're familiar with.
  - Connect a client from your instance to your provisioned service.
  - Deploy either web server or Layer-4 load-balancer to give external access to your client application.
