# DevOps Tooling
*Reading time, about 2 minutes. External study not included*

The tools in DevOps are centered around the processes and value streams that support the business. Said tools also promote visibility, openness and collaboration. Inherently following security patterns, audit trails and safety. No one person should be able to misuse one tool to cause major disturbance in a value stream without quick remediation plans.

Many times CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and/or Deployment) is considered synonymous with DevOps. That is both right and wrong. If the value stream inherently contains software, yes. 

## Key Attributes
These are some of the key elements of DevOps Tooling.

- Just the right amount of privileges for a particular task.
- Issue/project tracking, kanban, source code control, CI/CD, logging and reporting are essential.
- Visibility and traceability is a key element, no work should be hidden. By person or machine.

## Learning Resources
Curated list of learning resources for DevOps Tooling.

- **Reference:** [Periodic Table of DevOps Tools](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/)<br />
  The most comprehensive chart of current and popular DevOps tools.
- **Blog:** [Continuous integration vs. continuous delivery vs. continuous deployment](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment)<br />
  Distinguish the components of CI/CD and what each facet encompass.
- **Reference:** [Kanban](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/kanban/)<br />
  Understanding Kanban helps understanding flow of work to adjust tools to work for humans, not against them.

## Practical Exercises
How to get hands-on experience of DevOps Tooling.

- Study some of the tools available to perform automated tasks on complex systems.
  - [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io)
  - [Rundeck](https://rundeck.com)
  - [Ansible Tower](https://redhat.com/ansible)
  - [Morpheus Data](https://www.morpheusdata.com/)
  - [Delphix](https://delphix.com)

The common denominator across these platforms is the observability and the ability to limit scope of controls through Role-based Access Control (RBAC). Ensuring the tasks are well-defined, automated, scoped and safe to operate.
